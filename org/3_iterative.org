- Iterating the bike share model
- Using more than one ~State~ object
- Adding docstrings
- Dealing with negative bikes
- Introducing comparison operators
- Introducing metrics
  
* Summary

- We added a parameter, ~state~, so we can work with more than one ~State~
  object.
- We added a docstring that explains how to use a function and a
  comment that explains how it works.
- We used a conditional operator, ~==~, to check whether a bike is
  available, in order to avoid negative bikes.
- We added a state variable, ~city_empty~, to count the number of
  unhappy customers, which is a metric weâ€™ll use to quantify how well
  the system works.
