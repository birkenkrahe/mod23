- Decision making workflow model
- Differences between modeling and simulation
- Simulation modeling terminology
- Simple example: bike sharing simulation model
- Python support for simulation

* Decision making workflow model

In decision-making processes, the starting point is identifying the
problem that requires a change and therefore a decision.

A formal model is built that allows the simulation of the system to
understand its behavior and identify decisions to be made.

* Comparing modeling and simulation

A model is a representation of a physical system. Modeling is a design
process.

Simulation is the process of seeing how a model-based system would
work under certain conditions. Simulation is an operative process.

* Pros and cons of simulation modeling

Pros:
- System behavior that cannot be directly experienced is reproduced
- Real complex systems are represented with sources of uncertainty
- Limited data resources are required
- Experimentation in limited time is possible
- Resulting models are easily interpretable

Cons:
- Simulation provides indications but not exact results
- Analysis of the output can be complex
- Implementation of a simulation model can be laborious
- Results that are returned depend on the input data quality
- Simulation complexity depends on system complexity

* Simulation modeling terminology

1. System: a set of interacting elements with a boundary.
2. State variables: e.g. for weather, the temperature.
3. Events: causes state variables to change instantaneously.
4. Parameters: adjustable values that determine model behavior.
5. Calibration: adjusting paramters to obtain maximum accuracy.
6. Accuracy: degree of correspondence of simulation and actual data.
7. Sensitivity: degree to which model outputs are affected by input.
8. Validation: verification of the accuracy of the model.
