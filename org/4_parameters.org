To develop our model, we add more advanced programming methods:

- Functions that return values
- Loops and NumPy arrays
- Sweeping parameters
- Incremental model development
- Summary and exercises

A practice notebook is available in DataCamp workspace:
[[https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/bd527037-2e39-43e5-bc46-e8d9bf495b9b/edit][tinyurl.com/ParametersMetrics]]

* Concept and code summary

Concept:
- Iterative modeling means starting with a simple model, identifying
  the most important issues for the problem setting, and making
  gradual improvements.
- Variables are local to functions, and parameters can have defaults
  when using keywords for them.
- /Stochastic/ models produce different outcomes each time they are run,
  /deterministic/ models produce the same outcome each time they're run.
- Statistics that measure how well the system works are called /metrics/.

Code:
- We used a conditional operator, ~==~, to check whether a bike is
  available, in order to avoid negative bikes.
- We added a parameter, ~state~, so we can work with more than one ~State~
  object.
- We added a docstring that explains how to use a function and a
  comment that explains how it works.
- We added a state variable, ~city_empty~, to count the number of
  unhappy customers, which is a metric weâ€™ll use to quantify how well
  the system works.
