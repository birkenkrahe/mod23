* What are models?

  #+begin_quote
  "Models are formal structures represented in mathematics and
  diagrams that help us understand the world [...] practice modeling
  and you will better understand complex phenomena." (Page, 2021)

- If modeling is "defined" by the relationships shown in the diagram
  (from Downey's book p.4), where does coding with interactive
  notebooks fit in? More specifically, which parts of the workspace
  play a role in which part of the diagram? ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod23/blob/main/img/modeling.png][link]])
  #+begin_quote
  1) The workspace is a software system. It can be subjected to
     measurements, which generate data (about the workbook),
     e.g. session time.
  2) The notebook can be used to create a model of a real system:
     e.g. the unicorn data frame (and data set) is an abstraction
     because only certain features (columns) are retained.
  3) The model (data frame) can then be subjected to further analysis,
     e.g. we can build a model to predict the frequency of unicorns in
     industries based on the collected data (what type of model?)
  4) Sticking to the fact that the workspace itself is a system, we
     could predict future session time lengths based on previous
     usage. A lineplot would show the session times over time (that is a
     time series), and linear extrapolation would predict the evolution
     of the session times.
  5) To validate the prediction, further measurements can be taken and
     plotted alongside the prediction.
  #+end_quote

- These three results are the three outcomes of analytics:
  1) descriptive analysis tells us what has already happened;
  2) predictive analysis shows us what could happen;
  3) prescriptive analysis informs us what should happen.

- An alternative model: discuss the differences! ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod23/blob/main/img/modeling1.png][link]])

  #+begin_quote
  - "Simulation" (from Model to Prediction) is missing
  - "Validation" (from Prediction to Data) goes both ways while
    "interpretation" of a mathematical model only goes one way.
  - System is equivalent to Real-world data but instead of
    "verification" of the predictions or explanations, the first model
    posits measurements to obtain data which enter a feedback loop with
    the predictions.
  - The first model is more general, the second one only deals with
    mathematical modeling of real-world data.
  - Deep learning models for example, which are trained on real-world
    data and can be validated using test data, are not covered here.

* The Falling Penny Myth

Workspace problem: https://tinyurl.com/FallingPennyMythProblem

*Question:* Would a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State
Building go so fast that it would be embedded in the concrete; or if
it hit a person, would it break their skull?

*Solution 1:* strong assumptions.
#+begin_quote
$v = at$ is the velocity of an object after $t$ seconds.

The distance travelled is $x = at^2 / 2$.

The time until the penny reaches the sidewalk: $t=\sqrt{2x/a}$

For constant gravity $a = 9.8 m/s^2$ and the height of the Empire State
Building $x = 381 m$, we get $t = 8.8s$.

The velocity after that time is $v = 86 m/s$ (190 mph).
#+end_quote

Modeling assumptions: constant gravity (not true, varies with distance
even in classical mechanics), zero air resistance.

*Solution 2:* downward gravitational force and upward drag (or air
resistance) force are opposed and will eventually cancel each other
out so that the object will no longer be accelerated. It has now
reached /terminal velocity/.

Terminal velocity is reached when:
\begin{equation}
 m \cdot g = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C_d \cdot A \cdot \rho \cdot V_t^2 
\end{equation}

Solving for the velocity, we get:
\begin{equation}
 V_t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot m \cdot g}{C_d \cdot A \cdot \rho}}
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to
gravity, $C_d$ is the drag coefficient (empirical dimensionless weight
depending on the object in relation to the fluid), A is the
cross-sectional area of the object, and $\rho$ is the density of the
fluid through which the object is falling.

Substituting for our penny, this comes out to about 17 m/s or 38 mph
(while a sky diver, for example, will experience 53 m/s or 120 mph).

To see if and how this hurts, watch [[https://youtu.be/sJkdNnHhaoI?si=UBD7pdlJvpdBKIRG][this video]] by MythBusters (Your
Discovery Science, 2015).

So the first model was wrong and not useful to determine the truth of
the myth. The second model is still wrong but it's better and good
enough to refute the myth (via falsification).

Falsification here means: if I make a claim (the myth), and I can find
one empirical example that it is not true, my claim has lost its
generality and will no longer be scientifically valid.

* Computation in Python

Create a variable ~a~ to represent acceleration in meters per second
squared:
#+begin_src python :results silent
  a = 9.8
#+end_src
Create another variable to represent the time for the penny to drop,
let's say 3.4 seconds:
#+begin_src python results silent
  t = 3.4
#+end_src
Now we can compute the velocity ~v~ of the penny after ~t~ seconds
(ignoring air resistance):
#+begin_src python
  v = a * t
  print(v)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 33.32

What distance ~x~ would the penny travel during that time?
#+begin_src python
  x = a * t**2 / 2
  print(x)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 56.644

How long would it take for the penny to fall 381 m, the height of the
Empire States building? First, let's store the height in a variable ~h~:
#+begin_src python :results silent
  h = 381
#+end_src

To compute t, we need the square root function. We can import the
function from the NumPy package:
#+begin_src python :results silent
  from numpy import sqrt
#+end_src

Now we can use it to compute ~t~ in seconds:
#+begin_src python
  t = sqrt(2 * h / a)
  print(t)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 8.817885349720552

Finally, let's calculate the penny's velocity ~v~ in m/s:
#+begin_src python
  v = a * t
  print(v)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 86.41527642726142

*Exercise:* can you compute the terminal velocity for the penny given
this formula:
\begin{equation}
 V_t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot m \cdot g}{C_d \cdot A \cdot \rho}}
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is the mass of the object ($2.5\times 10^{-3} kg$), $g$ is
the acceleration due to gravity ($9.8 m/s^2$), $C_d$ is the drag
coefficient ($0.47$), A is the cross-sectional area of the object
($2.85\times 10^{-4} m^2$ - a penny has a radius of $9.525 mm$), and
$\rho$ is the density of the fluid through which the object is falling
($1.204 kg/m^3$).

Solution:
#+begin_src python
  # Assign constants
  m = 2.5e-3  # kg
  g = 9.8     # m/s^2
  c_d = 0.47    
  A = 2.85e-4 # m^2
  rho = 1.204

  # Compute terminal velocity
  v = sqrt((2 * m * g) / (c_d * A * rho))
  print(v)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 17.430644182450333

*Exercise*: check the penny area computation computationally.

*Solution:* we need the constant value for $\pi$, or we could
approximate it to 3.14, and the known area formula ($\pi r^2$):
#+begin_src python
  r = 9.525e-3
  A = r**2 * 3.14
  print(A)
  print(f'{round(A*1e4,2):.2f}')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0.0002848784625
: 2.85

Let's do it with a higher precision ~pi~ using ~NumPy~:
#+begin_src python
  from numpy import pi
  A = r**2 * pi
  print(A)
  print(f'{round(A*1e4,2):.2f}')  
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0.0002850229569923425
: 2.85

* Computation with Units

When we set ~h = 381~ and ~a = 9.81~, we left out the units. This can be
expensive, as the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1998 at a total
price of several hundred million dollars: different software computed
the thrust in different units leading to the loss of the orbiter in
the Mars atmosphere.

To represent units, we us the ~Pint~ library ([[https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][doc]]) and initialize a
~UnitRegistry()~ object. Without parameters, it contains a [[https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt][default list]]
of units and prefixes.
#+name: units
#+begin_src python
  from pint import UnitRegistry
  units = UnitRegistry()
#+end_src

In DataCamp workspace, ~pint~ is not installed. Go to the Environment
tab to search for it, and then you're offered to ~Add to notebook~. The
installation will be added as a cell at the top of the notebook.

The object ~units~ contains pretty much every unit you've ever heard of:
#+begin_src python
  <<units>>
  print(units.leagues)
  print(units.fortnight)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: league
: fortnight

You can list all units - how many are there altogether?
#+begin_example python
  len(list(units._units.keys())) # output: 953
  #+end_example

More importantly, Pint contains standard [[https://www.nist.gov/pml/owm/metric-si/si-units][SI units]] (International
System of Units) like meter and second:
#+name: meter_second
#+begin_src python
  <<units>>
  meter = units.meter
  second = units.second
  print(meter, second)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: meter_second
: meter second

We can use ~meter~ and ~second~ to create a variable ~a~ and give it the
value of acceleration due to gravity:
#+begin_src python
  a = 9.8 * meter / second**2
  print(a)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 9.8 meter / second ** 2

The object ~a~ is a quantity with two parts, ~magnitude~ and ~units~:
#+begin_src python
  print(a.magnitude)
  print(a.units)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 9.8
: meter / second ** 2

Create a quantity that represents 3.4s:
#+begin_src python
  t = 3.4 * second
  print(t)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3.4 second

Compute the distance a penny would fall after ~t~ seconds with constant
acceleration ~a~:
#+begin_src python
  print(a * t**2 / 2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 56.644 meter

If we create a quantity to represent the height of the Empire State
Building ~h~, we can compute the time the penny would take to reach the
sidewalk:
#+begin_src python
  from numpy import sqrt
  h = 381 * meter
  t = sqrt(2 * h / a)
  print(t)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 8.817885349720552 second

And finally the velocity of the penny on impact:
#+begin_src python
  v = a * t
  print(v)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 86.41527642726142 meter / second

If we want to convert this to imperial (US) units, we establish ~mile~
and ~hour~:
#+begin_src python
  mile = units.mile
  hour = units.hour

  print(v.to(mile/hour))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 193.30546802805432 mile / hour

To get help on the ~to~ function you can just enter ~v.to~ but the help is
highly obscure - typical Python. The online documentation might be
more useful:
#+begin_src python
  help(v.to)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
