- If modeling is "defined" by the relationships shown in the diagram
  (from Downey's book p.4), where does coding with interactive
  notebooks fit in? More specifically, which parts of the workspace
  play a role in which part of the diagram? ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod23/blob/main/img/modeling.png][link]])
  #+begin_quote
  1) The workspace is a software system. It can be subjected to
     measurements, which generate data (about the workbook),
     e.g. session time.
  2) The notebook can be used to create a model of a real system:
     e.g. the unicorn data frame (and data set) is an abstraction
     because only certain features (columns) are retained.
  3) The model (data frame) can then be subjected to further analysis,
     e.g. we can build a model to predict the frequency of unicorns in
     industries based on the collected data (what type of model?)
  4) Sticking to the fact that the workspace itself is a system, we
     could predict future session time lengths based on previous
     usage. A lineplot would show the session times over time (that is a
     time series), and linear extrapolation would predict the evolution
     of the session times.
  5) To validate the prediction, further measurements can be taken and
     plotted alongside the prediction.

- These three results are the three outcomes of analytics:
  1) descriptive analysis tells us what has already happened;
  2) predictive analysis shows us what could happen;
  3) prescriptive analysis informs us what should happen.

- An alternative model: discuss the differences! ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod23/blob/main/img/modeling1.png][link]])

  #+begin_quote
  - "Simulation" (from Model to Prediction) is missing
  - "Validation" (from Prediction to Data) goes both ways while
    "interpretation" of a mathematical model only goes one way.
  - System is equivalent to Real-world data but instead of
    "verification" of the predictions or explanations, the first model
    posits measurements to obtain data which enter a feedback loop with
    the predictions.
  - The first model is more general, the second one only deals with
    mathematical modeling of real-world data.
  - Deep learning models for example, which are trained on real-world
    data and can be validated using test data, are not covered here.

* Modeling Examples

** Weather forecasting

1. *System:* Earth's atmosphere (layers, temperature gradients,
   pressure differences, wind patterns).
2. *Model*: Computational model representing atmospheric interactions
   (Navier-Stokes PDEs, thermodynamic laws, radiation balance).
3. *Prediction*: Weather forecast (temperature, humidity, chance of
   precipitation).
4. *Data*: Real-time meteorogical data (current temperature, wind speed,
   satellite images).

** Stock market analysis

1. *System:* Stock market (stocks, indices, traders, economic
   indicators like interest rates, unemployment).
2. *Model*: Quantitative models to predict stock prices (Time Series
   forecasting, sentiment analysis, neural nets).
3. *Prediction*: Stock prices or trends.
4. *Data*: Historical stock prices, trading volumes, economic
   indicators, social media sentiment data.

** Epidemic spread   

1. *System:* Population of infected individuals who are exposed to,
   infected with, or recovered from a contagious disease.
2. *Model*: Compartmental SIR model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered)
   that uses ODEs to describe how individuals move between
   compartments over time.
3. *Prediction*: Project number of individuals in SIR compartments over
   time.
4. *Data*: Actual case counts, hospitalization rates, recovery rates,
   collected from hospitals, labs, public health agencies.
