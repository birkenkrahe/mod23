* Aug-29

** 1st sprint review and solo project ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1443/pages/solo-modeling-project][sign in]])

*Sources for your projects:*
- Personal pet projects (e.g. political science, language learning)
- My issues list at GitHub ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod482/issues][mod482]] or [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/mod23/issues][mod23]])

*Topics examples*:
- "Modeling the creative process: benefits, methods and feasibility"
- "The effects of eliminating gas burning cars in the US"
- "Introduction to simulation modeling and its application in engineering"
- "Why Failure?"
  
*Format examples:*
- Essay (minimum 2,500 words - ca. 5 pages, with references).
- Equivalent Jupyter notebook with an analysis (the Workbook demo has
  about 2,500 words), fully documented, with code and output.

** Review

- Which tools does DataCamp workspace offer?
  #+begin_quote
  1) Interactive notebook with text cells, Python and SQL code cells,
     AI assistance.
  2) Jupyter Lab with launcher for: file editor, console, markup file,
     terminal (shell), notebook.
  3) File management (upload, convert to data frame, SQL cell).
  4) Environment settings including notebook kernel, loaded Python
     packages, and environment variables (for the Linux OS).
  #+end_quote

- What is IPython?
  #+begin_quote
  Command shell for interactive computing originally only in Python,
  now also allowing notebooks in Julia, Python and R.
  #+end_quote 

- How can you get help for a Python function?
  #+begin_quote
  With the ~help~ function - but you need to know which package the
  function is from, e.g. ~pd.unique~ in ~pandas~, or ~np.array~ in NumPy.
  #+end_quote
  #+begin_src python
    import pandas as pd
    print(pd.unique.__module__)
    help(pd.core.algorithms)
  #+end_src

- How reliable the AI coding assistance?  
  
- Which Python functions did we use? (6)
  #+begin_example python
    import
    as
    help
    print
    pandas.read_csv
    pandas.unique
  #+end_example

** Test 1 (open in Canvas now until September 3)

** Continue the extended DataCamp demo
