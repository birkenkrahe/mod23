        "Iterative modeling means starting with a simple model, identifying the\nmost important issues for the problem setting, and making gradual\nimprovements.\n\nWhat assumptions is the bike share model based on? In which ways is it\nunrealistic - what are the differences between the model and the real\nworld?\n\n1.  Customer arrival probability varies over time.\n2.  Travel time between bike stations is not zero.\n3.  Bike availability is not guaranteed.\n4.  LEAP and Community Centre look completely different.\n5.  There are more customers at the Community Centre.\n6.  Customers come in different types.\n7.  Bikes come in different types.\n8.  Checking out bikes might cost money.\n\nAre any of these more relevant than others? Relevance depends on the\npurpose for the modeling simulation. What is our likely purpose?\n\n-   Understand the system with its elements, relationships, boundary and\n    the resulting states.\n\nFor this purpose, specific details about the elements (e.g. type of\nbike or type of customer) could be important once we've understood the\nbasic dynamics (i.e. evolution over time).\n\nThe different looks (and location in town) of our stations might\naffect the arrival/checkout probability: more students at LEAP but\nmore people overall at the Community Centre.\n\nTypes of customer is important if we're trying to make a prediction by\ncustomer type - like \"which age group is most likely to check out a\nbike?\" Same for the bike type - which bikes should we buy?\n\nThe first assumption (time dependency) can be neglected if we simulate\nover a short period of time (like one hour).\n\nThe second assumption (travel time between stations) might not affect\nthe results very much depending on the distance between stations - but\nif we're after the impact of this feature on the dynamic of the model,\nwe have to add it.\n\nThe third assumption is important because negative bike numbers are an\nobvious violation of the physical laws and just don't make sense.\n\n"

        "Our current `step` function model is *stochastic* because the arrival of\ncustomers is dictated by a randomized draw with varying\nprobabilities using `flip` - it's different every time.\n\nThe opposite extreme would be a *deterministic* model that does the same\nthing every time the model runs. Mathematical models that are based on\nevaluating closed mathematical expressions are deterministic by nature.\n\n**Could we build a deterministic model for the bike share system?** Yes,\nwe could, if we could figure out all the rules that affect our\nelements (customers, stations) and their relationships.\n\n**Which type of model is better?** It depends on the system. The\ndeterministic model makes exact predictions but cannot handle\nuncertainty (sudden change of rules), while the stochastic model\nhandles uncertainty well but is stable only for large numbers.\n\n**What would make the model better for the customer?** For example knowing\nthe probability of finding an available bike (to minimize the chance\nof not getting one, or maximize the chance of getting one).\n\n**What would make the model better for the owner?** For example knowing if\na customer got a bike or not (to minimize the number of customers who\ndon't get a bike or maximize the number of bikes in use).\n\nStatistics that quantify how well the system works are simulation\n*metrics*. \"How well\" is relative to the purpose of the\nsimulation. Applying metrics boils down to optimization.\n\n"

        "When modeling systems with human participation, we often (except in\nbinary situations like life or death) need to use indirect measures,\ne.g. we cannot know if a customer is really unhappy - but we can infer\nunhappiness if he arrives at a station and finds no bike available.\n\nBeing forced to quantify the unquantifiable has a good and a bad\nside. The good side is that it provides reliability - e.g. it enables\nus to send a man to the moon based on building a rocket for \"everyman\"\ninstead of exactly for the person who will sit in that rocket. The bad\nside is that it removes degrees of freedom from the system:\n\"un/happiness\" is a state of infinite gradation, a continuum that is\nrarely stable and usually changes from moment to moment. But to be\nable to compute things, we must simplify and freeze feelings.\n\nHere is a version of `bike_to_leap` that keeps track of the number of\nunhappy customers, measured in the number of customers who arrive at a\nstation with no bikes:\n\n"
