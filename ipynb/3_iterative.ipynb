        "Iterative modeling means starting with a simple model, identifying the\nmost important issues for the problem setting, and making gradual\nimprovements.\n\nWhat assumptions is the bike share model based on? In which ways is it\nunrealistic - what are the differences between the model and the real\nworld?\n\n1.  Customer arrival probability varies over time.\n2.  Travel time between bike stations is not zero.\n3.  Bike availability is not guaranteed.\n4.  LEAP and Community Centre look completely different.\n5.  There are more customers at the Community Centre.\n6.  Customers come in different types.\n7.  Bikes come in different types.\n8.  Checking out bikes might cost money.\n\nAre any of these more relevant than others? Relevance depends on the\npurpose for the modeling simulation. What is our likely purpose?\n\n-   Understand the system with its elements, relationships, boundary and\n    the resulting states.\n\nFor this purpose, specific details about the elements (e.g. type of\nbike or type of customer) could be important once we've understood the\nbasic dynamics (i.e. evolution over time).\n\nThe different looks (and location in town) of our stations might\naffect the arrival/checkout probability: more students at LEAP but\nmore people overall at the Community Centre.\n\nTypes of customer is important if we're trying to make a prediction by\ncustomer type - like \"which age group is most likely to check out a\nbike?\" Same for the bike type - which bikes should we buy?\n\nThe first assumption (time dependency) can be neglected if we simulate\nover a short period of time (like one hour).\n\nThe second assumption (travel time between stations) might not affect\nthe results very much depending on the distance between stations - but\nif we're after the impact of this feature on the dynamic of the model,\nwe have to add it.\n\nThe third assumption is important because negative bike numbers are an\nobvious violation of the physical laws and just don't make sense.\n\n"
